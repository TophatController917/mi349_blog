        <h2>The Morning</h2>
        <p>Beckett McKeough begins their day by wrenching themselves from their bed and getting breakfast. Today, they do not have the time to go to the dining hall and have a proper meal, so they instead walk to Sparty's and take their food to go.</p>

        <h2>The Schoolday</h2>
        <p>After getting some food, Beckett walks to class. Beckett goes to school at <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University.</a> Today they have three classes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Games Class</li>
            <li>Money Class</li>
            <li>Website Class</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After their first class, <em>disaster strikes.</em> It begins to rain, and Beckett has <strong>forgotten their umbrella!</strong> Beckett is forced to trek through the rain on the way to Money Class and gets soaked! Fortunately, the rain passes by the time Money Class is over, and Beckett walks to their final class nice and dry.</p>
