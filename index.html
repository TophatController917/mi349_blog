            <p>This is a typical day in the life of a person named Beckett McKeough.</p>
        </header>
        <section class="post-content">
                <p>Beckett McKeough begins their day by wrenching themselves from their bed and getting breakfast. Today, they do not have the time to go to the dining hall and have a proper meal, so they instead walk to Sparty's and take their food to go. After getting some food, Beckett walks to class. Beckett goes to school at <a href="https://msu.edu/">Michigan State University.</a> Today they have three classes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Games Class</li>
                    <li>Money Class</li>
                    <li>Website Class</li>
                </ol>
                <p>After their first class, <em>disaster strikes.</em> It begins to rain, and Beckett has <strong>forgotten their umbrella!</strong> Beckett is forced to trek through the rain on the way to Money Class and gets soaked! Fortunately, the rain passes by the time Money Class is over, and Beckett walks to their final class nice and dry. Once Beckett has finished their classes, they return home and get to work on their homework. They have quite a lot to work on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Games Homework</li>
                    <li>Money Homework</li>
                    <li>Money Exam Studying</li>
                    <li>Logic Exam Studying</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Beckett is a busy person, but they enjoy their day very much.</p>

            <h2>Squirrels around campus</h2>

            <p>Some observations about the squirrels around campus.</p>
        </header>
        <section class="post-content">
            <h4>Backstory</h4>
            <p>I walk around campus a lot in my day-to-day life, and that means I very often will see some squirrels running about. It's always fun to watch the critters, and although I often have places to be when I see them, that doesn't stop me from taking some time to watch them for a moment. Having done this for a fair time now, I decided to compile some of the observations I've made about the squirrels I see on campus.</p>
            <h4>The Squirrels</h4>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Squirrel Name</th>
                    <th>Squirrel Age, Length and Weight</th>
                    <th style="width:60%">Squirrel Summary</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hickory Von Bismarck</td>
                    <td>12 years old, 21.8 inches, 630 grams</td>
                    <td>I first saw Hickory climbing a tree by the red cedar river. She is the largest of the squirrels I've seen, and has quite a firey personality. One time, I saw her fighting with a goose. I say fighting, it was more that Hickory was running at the goose and squeeking menacingly, but the goose seemed quite intimidated.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Johan Squirrelbert</td>
                    <td>7 years old, 17 inches, 500 grams</td>
                    <td>Johan is a quite elusive squirrel. I often see him for just a moment before he dashes into a bush or up a tree. I have noted a small scar on his forehead, likely an injury he sustained when he was younger that has since healed.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sans</td>
                    <td>9 years old, 15.1 inches, 560 grams</td>
                    <td>Sans has a very distinct splotch of gray fur around his left eye that almost looks blue. I met him with a friend, who saw this splotch of fur and immediately demanded I name him sans. He's the calmest of the squirrels I've seen, never running away from anyone.</td>
                </tr>
