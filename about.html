        <h1>About me</h1>
        <img src="mckeoug8.jpg" alt="A man with sunglasses smiling.">
        <p>Hello! I'm Beckett, a gameplay programmer. I'm currently majoring in Games and Interactive Media at Michigan State University, a program that has ranked in the top 10 of game development programs in the country for over seven years. I am proud to have made the Dean's List for each of my first three semesters at MSU and intend to continue that success. I have taken several classes in game programming and design, and created several projects both in them and on my own. I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science to ensure I develop a broad range of programming skills. Some of the projects I've participated in are listed below.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Gordon Grappler</li>
            <li>Knight Fight</li>
            <li>Goose Genie</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Outside of class, I'm a member of MSU's professional game development fraternity Gamma Iota Mu, and I've taken part in several Game Jams, as well as longer projects working in MSU's Spartasoft Studio. It will probably come as no surprise to hear that I greatly enjoy game development; I love the teamwork, the creativity and the puzzle-solving experience of programming, and my dream is to create video games like the ones I love.</p>
